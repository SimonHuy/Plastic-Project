# Plastic-Project
Between 1950 and 2017, an estimated 9.2 billion tons of plastic were produced. Of that, only a quarter is still in use today and about 600 million tons are recycled. 
About 40% of plastic products are thrown away within a month. Every year we humans create about 300 million tons of plastic waste on the earth. 
It is estimated that between 50% and 80% of marine litter is plastic. By 2050, the total amount of plastic waste will be one-third of the total fish production in the ocean.

In order to limit the amount of plastic released into the environment, waste sorting is essential. 
Therefore, I personally created this project which uses machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify plastic and organic trash. 
I hope that in the near future there would have a robot using artificial intelligence to identify, classify and collect plastic trash for us.
